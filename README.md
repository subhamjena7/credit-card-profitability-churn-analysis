# Credit Card Customer Profitability & Churn Risk Analysis

## Business Problem
Banks often treat all credit card customers equally, despite differences in profitability and churn risk, leading to inefficient retention spending and revenue leakage.

## Objective
- Identify high-value customers
- Assess churn risk using behavioral signals
- Segment customers into actionable groups
- Recommend targeted retention strategies

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (MySQL)
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Power BI
- Excel

## Approach
1. Data extraction and validation using SQL
2. Data cleaning, feature engineering, and churn signal creation in Python
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Customer segmentation by value and churn risk
5. Retention strategy mapping
6. Interactive Power BI dashboards for decision-making

## Key Insights
- Revenue is highly concentrated among a small customer segment
- High-value customers are not immune to churn
- Payment delays and high utilization are strong churn indicators
- Credit limits alone do not predict profitability

## Business Impact
Targeted retention strategies can conservatively protect ₹0.4–0.8 million in revenue by reducing churn among high-value customers.

## Deliverables
- Power BI dashboards (PDF & PBIX)
- Executive summary & recommendations
- Revenue impact estimation
