    "## Objective of This Phase\n",
    "The objective of the Retention Strategy Mapping phase is to translate analytical insights into **clear, actionable business decisions**.  \n",
    "This phase directly addresses the core business problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Now that we know who is valuable and who is at risk, what should the bank actually do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "By mapping each customer segment to a tailored retention strategy, the bank can:\n",
    "- Reduce revenue leakage\n",
    "- Optimize retention costs\n",
    "- Improve customer lifetime value\n",
    "- Focus resources where they generate maximum impact\n",

    "\n",
    "## Retention Strategy Design Principles\n",
    "The following BFSI-aligned principles guided the strategy design:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Retention budgets are finite and must be allocated selectively  \n",
    "2. High-value customers justify higher retention investment  \n",
    "3. Not all churn should be prevented if retention costs exceed value  \n",
    "4. Strategies must be explainable, scalable, and business-friendly  \n",
